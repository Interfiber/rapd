# Rust Audio Player Daemon
Cause mpd was annoying

## What rapd trys to do
Rapd is not a spotify client, or an advanced music player. Its an audio/music daemon that runs in the background that accepts connections via its TCP socket.
Rapd aims to be a fast, lightweight, free, and open-source program to play music or audio on you're machine and thats it.

## Why not mpd?
Mpd is a cool concept, if it worked(for me). It had weird permisson problems with my music folder, and other things that bugged me.
